# Overview
This repo contains assorted programs and functions for using numerical methods and solving common problems in systems biology. 

# Numerical Methods

Numerical methods are techniques for finding approximate solutions to mathematicaal problems that may not have exact solutions. Additionally, numerical methods generally rely on iterative precedures and discretization to produce a sequence of approximations that converge to a true solution, and as a result they are  particuarly helpful for solving differential equations, optimization problems, and systems of equations where traditional algebraic methods are not possible, or are impractical. 

Below you'll find a list of numerical methods for which I've provided functions to carry out. Additional numerical methods will be added to this repository over time.

- [Euler's Method](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical-methods/blob/main/eulers_method.py)
  - Euler's method is a simple numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and works by approximating the solution over small steps.
- [Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4)](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical-methods/blob/main/runge_kutta_RK4.py)
  - The RK4 method is a more accurate method for solving ODEs compared to Euler's method. RK4 reduces error by taking a weighted average of slopes at different points within the interval, and it's known for it's balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. 
 
# Systems Biology

Below you'll find a list of programs and functions for solving common problems in systems biology. Additional methods will be added to this repository over time.

- [Binomial Mutations Calculator](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical_methods_and_systems_bio/blob/main/binomial_mutation_calculator.py)
  - A binomial process is related to the binomial distribution, which describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success. This code calculates the probability of observing exactly k mutations in n DNA bases, given a mutation rate p, using the binomial distribution formula. 
- [Poisson Mutation Calculator](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical_methods_and_systems_bio/blob/main/poisson_mutation_calculator.py)
  - A Poisson process is related to the Poisson distribution, which describes the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space, where these events happen independently of each other and at a constant average rate. This code calculates the probability of observing exactly k mutations given an average mutation rate Î», using the Poisson distribution formula.
