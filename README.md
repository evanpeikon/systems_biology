### Overview
This repo contains assorted functions for performing numerical methods and solving problems in systems biology. 

# Numerical Methods

Numerical methods are techniques for finding approximate solutions to mathematicaal problems that may not have exact solutions. Additionally, numerical methods generally rely on iterative precedures and discretization to produce a sequence of approximations that converge to a true solution, and as a result they are  particuarly helpful for solving differential equations, optimization problems, and systems of equations where traditional algebraic methods are not possible, or are impractical. 

Below you'll find a list of numerical methods for which I've provided functions to carry out. Additional numerical methods will be added to this repository over time.

- [Euler's Method](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical-methods/blob/main/eulers_method.py)
  - Euler's method is a simple numerical technique for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and works by approximating the solution over small steps.
- [Runge-Kutta 4th Order Method (RK4)](https://github.com/evanpeikon/numerical-methods/blob/main/runge_kutta_RK4.py)
  - The RK4 method is a more accurate method for solving ODEs compared to Euler's method. RK4 reduces error by taking a weighted average of slopes at different points within the interval, and it's known for it's balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.
